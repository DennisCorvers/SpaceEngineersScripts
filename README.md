# SpaceEngineersScripts
A collection of in-game scripts for Space Engineers' Terminal

In order to use one of these scripts, simple copy the contents of one of the .cs files into the terminal. Copy ONLY the contents of the class! For example, for the file EngineMonitor/cs, copy everything from line 24 ( { symbol) up to and including line 106 ( } symbol).

Alternatively, some of these scripts can also be found on the Steam Workshop under https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198059932845/myworkshopfiles/
